## Knowledge base

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Tagrand/knowledgeBase.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Tagrand/knowledgeBase)

This is just a place for me to dump facts, arguments and sources - but also be able to quickly get them too.

I find I read some things, they're good ideas, but often I have no structured way of linking them to other ideas.


## Learning

This is mainly to keep my laravel sharp - but also manage a whole project myself, rather than working as a team. So it's going to test my memory a bit more.

Along the side, I'm writing a setup guide and laravel cheatsheets to help speed up the process next time.

One thing so far I've really appreciated is how much time it can just take to set up a db structure and api's, next time I may just try using

- The site is getting more of a clear direction. I find after a few days on a project, I get better at working out the specifics, what won't work, what will work.
- I am prone to rushing, I do need to slow down at points.
- Add new stuff is getting easier now, which is also dangerous - as I could over complicate.
- Vuex is making a CRUDDY approach easier.
- By not working on design, its making it much easier to let it take shape. Less constrained.

The front end is coming together, I just need to do the arguments, and then I should have a base working project.

The main thing I am wondering, is how to extract out all the designs into templates - I'd like to start using slots to simplify the front end code, and make it more flexible.

I've found this approach quite good, but I would like to be a bit more disciplined and have more refactor/tidy points. There are certainly places I rushed too - which has led to more technical debt that I had to fix later. But having said that, letting it be messy at the start meant I followed through more with the project. And it's more substansive than anything else I've made before in my spare time.

A few key points to tidy
1) The store.js is getting very heavy, I'd also like to improve the dispatch/mutate methods. 

2) Looking to use Vue slots to tidy up the components, make them more reusable. 

3) I'm currently working on the design in figma. So that's currently a work in progress. 

4) Need to find a good UI approach to linking facts and arguements (as you can have both facts for and against arguments.)

## Approach

Two key things I'm focusing on developing:

1) Spotting repeated patterns and work. How can I make it quicker to set up a project? Are there bits that I can essentialy write step by step guides to? This applies to both my coding but also my actual process of planning.

2) Don't refactor until necessary - so allowing the code to get messy, then when it starts to pain, start thinking about tidying. As bad abstraction is worse than messy code. Trying to balance mess against flexibility is quite a tricky skill, and is something I'm working on.

A few things I'm keeping from previous experiments:

1) Emojicommit - I find this makes me aware of my cycle of work. Am I rushing (aka do I keep using bug commits). Do I find I just do all the backend in one go and then front or more free flowing? Am I doing enough refactoring and tidying (aka art and recycle emojii's).

2) Pausing to write relections in my readme. It helps me improve my code process, and be more aware.

3) Breaking if I get stuck on a problem for 15 minutes or more. It's amazing how a break works when staring at a problem obcessively doesn't.

This is also my first serious project dont in VSCode, so I'm getting used to a more general purpose editor after using PhPStorm. Mainly because I like the idea of a general purpose editor, which I can adapt to all languages. Also I keep hearing really good things about it.
